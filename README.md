Banking Analytics Dashboard

End-to-End Banking Dashboard using Power BI, Python, and SQL

📊 Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow for a banking institution, including data extraction, transformation, and visualization. The final output is a fully interactive Power BI dashboard providing insights into customer behavior, loan performance, and branch efficiency.

🎯 Objectives

Track and visualize key banking KPIs: total deposits, loan distribution, recovery rates, and revenue.

Analyze customer segmentation based on demographics and activity.

Monitor performance metrics across different branches and time periods.

Enable strategic decision-making for stakeholders.
